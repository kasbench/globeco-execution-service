# Cursor Log

[2024-06-10] Request: Review requirements.md and execution-plan.md, then execute step 1 of execution-plan.md (configure project to connect to PostgreSQL database on host 'globeco-execution-service-postgresql', port 5436, database 'postgres', user 'postgres').

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 2 of execution-plan.md (configure Flyway with the same configuration as the PostgreSQL database connection).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 3 of execution-plan.md (configure the project to use PostgreSQL and Kafka test containers).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 4 of execution-plan.md (configure a Kafka producer using the requirements in the Kafka section of requirements.md, ensuring the program creates the topic if it doesn't exist).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 5 of execution-plan.md (create a Flyway migration to deploy the schema for this project using the schema in execution-service.sql).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 6 of execution-plan.md (implement the entity, repository, service interface, and service implementation for execution using the requirements in requirements.md).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 7 of execution-plan.md (implement unit tests for the entity, repository, service interface, and service implementation for execution, using test containers).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 8 of execution-plan.md (implement caching for execution using Spring's caching abstraction with Caffeine, 5 minute TTL, as required).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 9 of execution-plan.md (implement unit testing for execution caching).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 10 of execution-plan.md (implement the DTOs in the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) section of requirements.md).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 11 of execution-plan.md (implement the APIs in the REST API Documentation section of requirements.md).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 12 of execution-plan.md (implement tests for the APIs generated in the previous step).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 13 of execution-plan.md (modify the POST API and corresponding test to perform the specified steps in a transaction: save to DB, set sentTimestamp, send to Kafka, update DB with sentTimestamp).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 14 of execution-plan.md (implement liveness, readiness, and startup health checks for Kubernetes deployment).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 15 of execution-plan.md (document the service completely in README.md).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 16 of execution-plan.md (create a Dockerfile for this application).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute step 17 of execution-plan.md (create all files necessary to deploy this application as a service to Kubernetes, including liveness, readiness, and startup probes, with the specified resource limits and scaling. Place files in the k8s directory).

[2024-06-10] Request: Execute steps 18 and 19 of execution-plan.md (expose the OpenAPI schema as an endpoint using Springdoc OpenAPI and add the URLs for the OpenAPI schema to the README.md file).

[2024-06-10] Request: Switch all tests to use Testcontainers for Kafka, so tests do not hang if Kafka is not available.

[2024-05-21] Added kafka.topic.orders=orders to src/test/resources/application.properties to resolve test failures caused by missing placeholder for Kafka topic in test context.

[2024-06-10] Removed spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers= from src/test/resources/application.properties to allow @DynamicPropertySource to set the value for Testcontainers, resolving the Kafka bootstrap server error in tests.

[2024-06-10] Added spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers= to src/test/resources/application.properties to resolve PlaceholderResolutionException in tests due to missing property required by KafkaProducerConfig. Testcontainers will override this value at runtime.

[2024-06-10] Updated TestcontainersConfiguration to provide a static KafkaContainer and a @DynamicPropertySource for spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers, ensuring correct Kafka bootstrap server injection for all tests and resolving Kafka producer errors in test context.

[2024-06-10] Refactored KafkaProducerConfig to use constructor injection for bootstrapServers and ordersTopic instead of @Value field injection, ensuring correct property resolution in tests with Testcontainers and resolving Kafka producer errors.

[2024-06-10] Updated KafkaProducerConfig to use fallback values in @Value annotations for bootstrapServers and ordersTopic, preventing PlaceholderResolutionException if properties are missing in tests.

[2024-06-10] Removed trailing space from kafka.topic.orders in src/test/resources/application.properties to fix InvalidTopicException in Kafka tests.

2024-06-09: Added a global CORS configuration by creating a new WebConfig class in src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_execution_service/WebConfig.java. This configuration allows all origins, methods, and headers for all endpoints, ensuring cross-origin requests are permitted as required.

Reviewed and updated documentation/supplemental-requirement-1.md for clarity and actionability. Expanded the ## Steps section to provide detailed, step-by-step implementation instructions, clarified requirements, and ensured terminology and formatting are consistent throughout the document, as per user request.
