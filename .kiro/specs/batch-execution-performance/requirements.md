# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current batch execution implementation processes executions one-at-a-time within a single transaction, which creates performance bottlenecks and fails under load. This feature will redesign the batch execution process to use bulk database operations and asynchronous messaging for improved scalability and performance, with relaxed transactional guarantees.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want batch execution processing to handle high-volume loads without failing, so that the system remains stable under peak traffic conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a batch execution request contains more than 100 executions THEN the system SHALL process the batch without timing out or failing
2. WHEN concurrent batch execution requests are submitted THEN the system SHALL handle them without database deadlocks or connection pool exhaustion
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN batch execution response times SHALL remain within acceptable limits (under 30 seconds for batches of 1000 executions)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want batch executions to use bulk database operations instead of individual inserts, so that database performance is optimized for high-volume scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a batch of executions THEN the system SHALL use bulk insert operations to minimize database round trips
2. WHEN a batch contains more than a configurable threshold (default 500) THEN the system SHALL split the batch into multiple bulk operations
3. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity before committing to the database
4. WHEN a bulk operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information indicating which specific executions failed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want Kafka messaging to be asynchronous with retry capabilities, so that temporary messaging failures don't block the entire batch processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executions are successfully saved to the database THEN Kafka messages SHALL be sent asynchronously without blocking the response
2. WHEN a Kafka message fails to send THEN the system SHALL retry the message according to a configurable retry policy (default: 3 retries with exponential backoff)
3. WHEN all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue processing other messages
4. WHEN Kafka is temporarily unavailable THEN the batch execution SHALL still complete successfully with database persistence

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to receive immediate feedback on batch execution results, so that I can quickly identify any validation or processing issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a batch execution completes THEN the response SHALL include the count of successful and failed executions
2. WHEN individual executions fail validation THEN the response SHALL include specific error details for each failed execution
3. WHEN database operations succeed but Kafka messaging fails THEN the execution SHALL be marked as successful in the response
4. WHEN the batch processing completes THEN the response time SHALL be significantly improved compared to the current implementation (target: 80% reduction for large batches)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want configurable batch processing parameters, so that I can tune performance based on system capacity and load patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the bulk operation batch size SHALL be configurable via application properties
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN Kafka retry policies (attempts, backoff intervals) SHALL be configurable
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN database connection pool settings SHALL be optimized for bulk operations
4. WHEN system load changes THEN operators SHALL be able to adjust batch processing parameters without code changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and monitoring for the new batch processing system, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN detailed metrics SHALL be recorded (execution counts, processing times, error rates)
2. WHEN Kafka retry attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log retry attempts with appropriate log levels
3. WHEN batch processing completes THEN performance metrics SHALL be available for monitoring and alerting
4. WHEN errors occur during batch processing THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient logging for troubleshooting without exposing sensitive data
