# Design Document

## Overview

The current batch execution implementation processes executions sequentially within a single transaction, causing performance bottlenecks and failures under load. This design introduces a high-performance batch processing architecture that uses bulk database operations, asynchronous messaging, and configurable processing parameters to achieve significant performance improvements while maintaining data consistency where needed.

## Architecture

### Current Architecture Issues
- Single transaction wrapping all executions creates long-running transactions
- Sequential processing (one-at-a-time) doesn't utilize database bulk capabilities
- Synchronous Kafka messaging blocks the entire batch on messaging failures
- No configurability for batch processing parameters
- Poor scalability under concurrent load

### New Architecture Principles
- **Bulk Operations**: Use database bulk insert/update operations to minimize round trips
- **Asynchronous Messaging**: Decouple Kafka messaging from database persistence
- **Configurable Batching**: Allow tuning of batch sizes based on system capacity
- **Resilient Error Handling**: Continue processing when individual items fail
- **Relaxed Transactional Guarantees**: Prioritize performance over strict ACID compliance

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Enhanced ExecutionService Interface

```java
public interface ExecutionService {
    // Existing methods remain unchanged
    
    /**
     * Create multiple executions using optimized bulk operations.
     * @param batchRequest The batch request containing multiple executions
     * @return BatchExecutionResponseDTO containing results for each execution
     */
    BatchExecutionResponseDTO createBatchExecutions(BatchExecutionRequestDTO batchRequest);
}
```

### 2. Bulk Processing Components

#### BulkExecutionProcessor
- Handles validation and preparation of execution batches
- Splits large batches into configurable chunks for optimal database performance
- Manages bulk database operations with proper error handling

#### AsyncKafkaPublisher
- Handles asynchronous Kafka message publishing with retry logic
- Implements configurable retry policies with exponential backoff
- Provides dead letter queue functionality for failed messages

#### BatchProcessingConfiguration
- Centralizes all batch processing configuration parameters
- Provides runtime configurability without code changes

### 3. Enhanced Repository Layer

#### ExecutionRepository Extensions
```java
public interface ExecutionRepository extends JpaRepository<Execution, Integer> {
    /**
     * Bulk insert executions using native SQL for optimal performance.
     * @param executions List of executions to insert
     * @return List of inserted executions with generated IDs
     */
    List<Execution> bulkInsert(List<Execution> executions);
    
    /**
     * Bulk update sent timestamps for executions.
     * @param executionIds List of execution IDs to update
     * @param sentTimestamp The timestamp to set
     * @return Number of updated records
     */
    int bulkUpdateSentTimestamp(List<Integer> executionIds, OffsetDateTime sentTimestamp);
}
```

## Data Models

### Configuration Properties
```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "batch.execution")
public class BatchExecutionProperties {
    private int bulkInsertBatchSize = 500;
    private int maxConcurrentBatches = 10;
    private boolean enableAsyncKafka = true;
    private KafkaRetryProperties kafka = new KafkaRetryProperties();
    
    public static class KafkaRetryProperties {
        private int maxAttempts = 3;
        private long initialDelay = 1000;
        private double backoffMultiplier = 2.0;
        private long maxDelay = 30000;
    }
}
```

### Enhanced Execution Entity
The existing Execution entity remains unchanged, but we'll optimize how it's used in bulk operations.

### Batch Processing Context
```java
public class BatchProcessingContext {
    private final List<ExecutionPostDTO> originalRequests;
    private final List<Execution> validatedExecutions;
    private final List<ExecutionResultDTO> results;
    private final Map<Integer, Exception> validationErrors;
    
    // Methods for tracking processing state
}
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Strategy
1. **Pre-validation**: Validate all executions before any database operations
2. **Fail-fast**: Return validation errors immediately for invalid executions
3. **Partial Success**: Continue processing valid executions even if some fail validation

### Database Error Handling
1. **Bulk Operation Failures**: If bulk insert fails, fall back to individual inserts for error isolation
2. **Constraint Violations**: Capture and report specific constraint violations
3. **Connection Issues**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Kafka Error Handling
1. **Asynchronous Retries**: Implement configurable retry policies
2. **Dead Letter Queue**: Route permanently failed messages to DLQ
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable Kafka publishing if broker is unavailable
4. **Monitoring**: Track message success/failure rates for alerting

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **BulkExecutionProcessor**: Test batch splitting, validation, and error handling
- **AsyncKafkaPublisher**: Test retry logic, circuit breaker, and error scenarios
- **Repository Extensions**: Test bulk operations with various data scenarios

### Integration Testing
- **Database Performance**: Measure bulk insert performance vs individual inserts
- **Kafka Integration**: Test asynchronous publishing with broker failures
- **End-to-End Batch Processing**: Test complete batch workflows with mixed success/failure scenarios

### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Test with batches of 100, 500, 1000+ executions
- **Concurrent Batch Testing**: Test multiple simultaneous batch requests
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor database connections, memory usage, and thread utilization
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare performance against current implementation

### Error Scenario Testing
- **Database Failures**: Test behavior during database connectivity issues
- **Kafka Failures**: Test behavior during Kafka broker unavailability
- **Mixed Validation**: Test batches with both valid and invalid executions
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Test behavior under high load conditions
