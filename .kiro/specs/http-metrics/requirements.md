# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements standardized HTTP request metrics for the Globeco Execution Service microservice that can be exported to the OpenTelemetry (Otel) Collector. The implementation will provide consistent observability across the service by tracking HTTP request patterns, response times, and concurrent request loads. The metrics will follow the enhanced-metrics.md specification and leverage lessons learned from the java-microservice-http-metrics-implementation-guide.md to avoid common implementation pitfalls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to monitor HTTP request counts across all endpoints, so that I can track service usage patterns and identify high-traffic endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request is processed THEN the system SHALL increment a counter metric named `http_requests_total`
2. WHEN recording the counter metric THEN the system SHALL include labels for `method` (HTTP method), `path` (route pattern), and `status` (HTTP status code as string)
3. WHEN the counter is incremented THEN the system SHALL use uppercase HTTP method names (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
4. WHEN recording the path label THEN the system SHALL use route patterns like "/api/executions/{id}" instead of actual URLs with parameters
5. WHEN recording the status label THEN the system SHALL convert numeric HTTP status codes to strings ("200", "404", "500")

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to measure HTTP request durations with histogram buckets, so that I can analyze response time distributions and identify performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request is processed THEN the system SHALL record duration in a histogram metric named `http_request_duration`
2. WHEN recording duration THEN the system SHALL measure from request entry to response completion with microsecond accuracy
3. WHEN configuring the histogram THEN the system SHALL use buckets optimized for millisecond values: [5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000] milliseconds
4. WHEN recording duration THEN the system SHALL include the same labels as the counter metric (method, path, status)
5. WHEN timing requests THEN the system SHALL record duration in milliseconds for OpenTelemetry Collector compatibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor concurrent HTTP requests, so that I can understand current load and detect potential resource contention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request starts processing THEN the system SHALL increment a gauge metric named `http_requests_in_flight`
2. WHEN an HTTP request completes processing THEN the system SHALL decrement the in-flight gauge regardless of success or failure
3. WHEN tracking in-flight requests THEN the system SHALL not include any labels on the gauge metric
4. WHEN multiple requests are processed concurrently THEN the system SHALL accurately track the count using thread-safe operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want to scrape metrics from a standardized endpoint, so that I can collect observability data for dashboards and alerting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is running THEN the system SHALL expose metrics at the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint
2. WHEN metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL return data in Prometheus text format compatible with OpenTelemetry Collector
3. WHEN the metrics endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL include all HTTP metrics along with standard Spring Boot Actuator metrics
4. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with the existing OpenTelemetry Collector configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want metrics collection to not interfere with normal request processing, so that observability doesn't impact service reliability or performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics recording fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue processing the HTTP request normally
2. WHEN an exception occurs during request processing THEN the system SHALL still record metrics before propagating the exception
3. WHEN recording metrics THEN the system SHALL minimize performance overhead and avoid blocking request processing
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL use thread-safe metric recording without causing contention
5. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL pre-register metrics with sample tags to ensure immediate visibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a service operator, I want metrics to be recorded for all HTTP traffic, so that I have complete visibility into service interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any HTTP request is received THEN the system SHALL record metrics regardless of endpoint type (API, health checks, actuator endpoints)
2. WHEN error responses occur (4xx, 5xx) THEN the system SHALL record metrics with appropriate status codes
3. WHEN requests result in exceptions THEN the system SHALL record metrics before the exception is handled
4. WHEN the filter processes requests THEN the system SHALL handle both successful and failed requests consistently
5. WHEN path normalization is applied THEN the system SHALL replace numeric IDs and UUIDs with placeholders to prevent metric cardinality explosion
